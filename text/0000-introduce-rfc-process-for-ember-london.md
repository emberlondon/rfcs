# Introduce RFC process for Ember London

## Summary

Adopt an RFC process for discussing and enacting changes in the Ember London
community meetups and tooling.


## Motivation

As the needs of the community evolves it makes sense for the community tools to
evolve with it. Ember's own RFC process has been successful in helping to
inclusively manage changes that affect the framework and by extension its
community. By adopting this approach for actioning changes in the Ember London
community, it is hoped that these tools will better keep up with the needs of
their users.

## Detailed design

1. Merge this PR.
2. Monitor, review and adopt ideas proposed as RFCs.

## How we teach this

Curators for emberlondon's git repos and organisers of the Meetups respond to
ideas by introducing the Ember London RFC process, referencing the
success of Ember's RFC process.

## Drawbacks

If there isn't much momentum or desire for change, then an RFC process could add
weight such that motivated groups or individuals don't action their ideas.

## Alternatives

Relying on strong yet approachable group leaders willing to support those who
come to the community with energy and good ideas is an option.

There is a tradeoff between freedom to act vs inclusion of the hive mind.

## Unresolved questions

Who is available to engage the community using this channel?
What should we do if the curators leave the community?
Is the engaged community of a size that we need a process like this right now?
